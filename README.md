# Module 5 - Intermediate Lab: Cryptography

## Background
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum make use of an Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA). The use of cryptographic systems like this involves certification of some data (e.g. a transaction) by or authentication of the possessors of the private keys, and verification by the possessors of public keys. ECDSA is not the only type of algorithm capable of meeting these needs, so in this lab we will explore and compare the pros and cons of ECDSA with those of an other, more popular cryptographic system: RSA.
