# Module 5 - Intermediate Lab: Cryptography

## Background
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum make use of an Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA). The use of cryptographic systems like this involves certification of some data (e.g. a transaction) by or authentication of the possessors of the private keys, and verification by the possessors of public keys. ECDSA is a different paradigm than that of the commonly used RSA-key cryptography. This lab will explore more about it.

2. Answer the following questions:
* In simple terms, what is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange used for?
* An Elliptic Curve is just some set of numbers. (TRUE OR FALSE)
* In Elliptic Curve cryptography, there is a point called the Generator. This point is known by all parties. What is the Generator point in Bitcoin? (Use the internet! Here’s a hint: The curve that Bitcoin uses is called secp256k1)
* Does adding Generator points to each other make points on the graph look random? (TRUE OR FALSE)
* When adding Generator points together, is it possible to intersect more than one point? (TRUE OR FALSE)
* What is a private key in the context of Elliptic Curve Cryptography?
* If I have private key a and you have private key b, and we know the Generator point G, what is our shared secret?
